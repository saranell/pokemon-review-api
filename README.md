# Pokemon Review API

My project uses the ASP.NET Core Web API 2022 tutorial from [teddysmithdev](https://github.com/teddysmithdev/pokemon-review-api)'s [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL82C6-O4XrHdiS10BLh23x71ve9mQCln0) channel. I followed along with the videos to get more practice with APIs using MVC after finishing LC's Women+ in Feb. 2023. Just for fun!
